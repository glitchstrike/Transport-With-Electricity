        <h1>Government Policies</h1>
        <p>
          In India, the first concrete decision to incentivise electric vehicles was taken in 2010. According to a Rs 95-crore scheme approved by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), the government announced a financial incentive for manufacturers for electric vehicles sold in India. The scheme, effective from November 2010, envisaged incentives of up to 20 per cent on ex-factory prices of vehicles, subject to a maximum limit. However, the subsidy scheme was later withdrawn by the MNRE in March 2012.<sup><a href="#section1">[1]</a></sup></p>
 
         <p> In 2011, the then Government had come up with the National Mission on Electric Mobility ("NMEP").In 2013, India unveiled the 'National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020' to make a major shift to electric vehicles and to address the issues of national energy security, vehicular pollution and growth of domestic manufacturing capabilities. Though the scheme was to offer subsidies and create supporting infrastructure for e-vehicles, the plan mostly remained on papers. While presenting the Union Budget for 2015-16 in Parliament, then finance minister Arun Jaitley announced faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles (FAME), with an initial outlay of Rs 75 crore. The scheme was announced with an aim to offer incentives for clean-fuel technology cars to boost their sales to up to 7 million vehicles by 2020.<sup><a href="#section1">[1]</a></sup></p>
           
         <p> In 2017, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari made a statement showing India’s intent to move to 100 per cent electric cars by 2030. However, the automobile industry raised concerns over the execution of such a plan. The government subsequently diluted the plan from 100 per cent to 30 per cent.<sup><a href="#section1">[1]</a></sup></p>
           
         <p> In February 2019, the Union Cabinet cleared a Rs 10,000-crore programme under the FAME-II scheme. This scheme came into force from April 1, 2019. The main objective of the scheme is to encourage a faster adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles by offering upfront incentives on purchase of electric vehicles and also by establishing necessary charging infrastructure for EVs.<sup><a href="#section1">[1]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Central as well as State governments have been promoting adoption of EVs by providing fiscal as well as non-fiscal incentives. Some of the incentives being provided on purchase of EVs are: • Upfront capital subsidy under FAME India Scheme Phase II • Goods & Services Tax (GST) on EVs has been reduced from 12% to 5%, • Income tax deduction can be claimed on the interest paid on loans taken for purchase of EVs.<sup><a href="#section2">[2]</a></sup></p>
