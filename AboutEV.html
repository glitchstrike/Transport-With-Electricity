        <h2>About Electric Vehicle</h2>
        <p> Electric Vehicles (EVs) are run by electric motors which are powered by energy stored in batteries,solar pannels, fuel Cell or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity . 
          EVs have an electric motor instead of an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). As an EV runs on electricity. The vehicle emits no exhaust from a tailpipe i.e. it has zero tail pipe emission and does not contain components, such as a fuel pump, fuel line, or fuel tank. </p>
        <p> EVs include, but are not limited to, road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft, electric spacecraft.</p>

        <h2>Parts of Electric Vehicle</h2>
        <ul><li><strong>Electric Engine/Moto</strong>r&nbsp;- Provides power to rotate the wheels. It can be DC/AC type, however, AC motors are more common.<sup><a href="#section2">[2]</a></sup></li><li><strong>Inverter&nbsp;</strong>- Converts the electric current in the form of Direct Current (DC) into Alternating Current (AC)</li><li><strong>Drivetrain&nbsp;</strong>- EVs have a single-speed transmission which sends power from the motor to the wheels.</li><li><strong>Batteries&nbsp;</strong>- Store&nbsp;the electricity required to run an EV. The higher the kW of the battery, the higher the range.</li><li><strong>Charging&nbsp;</strong>- Plug into an outlet or EV charging point to charge your battery.</li></ul>
        <h2>How EV Moves</h2>
        <p>
          EVâ€™s are like an automatic car. They have a forward and reverse mode. When you place the vehicle in gear and press on the accelerator pedal these things happen:

          <ul><li>Power is converted from the DC battery to AC for the electric motor<sup><a href="#section1">[1]</a></sup></li>
            <li>The accelerator pedal sends a signal to the controller which adjusts the vehicle's speed by changing the frequency of the AC power from the inverter to the motor</li>
            <li>The motor connects and turns the wheels through a cog</li>
            <li>When the brakes are pressed or the car is decelerating, the motor becomes an alternator and produces power, which is sent back to the battery</li></ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Electric Vehicle</h2>
        <p>There are a few different types of electric vehicle (EV). Some run purely on electricity, these are called pure electric vehicles. And some can also be run on petrol or diesel, these are called hybrid electric vehicles.<sup><a href="#section1">[1]</a></sup></p>
        <ul><li><strong>Plug-in electric</strong>&nbsp;- This means the car runs purely on electricity and gets all its power when it's plugged in to charge. This type doesn't need petrol or diesel to run so doesn't produce any emissions like traditional cars.<sup><a href="#section3">[3]</a></sup></li>
          <img src="images/electric-high-res.jpg" class="img-fluid"/>
          <li><strong>Plug-in hybrid</strong>&nbsp;- These cars mainly run on electricity but also have a traditional fuel engine so you can use petrol or diesel too&nbsp;if they run out of charge. When running on fuel, these cars will produce emissions but when they're running on electricity, they won't. Plug-in hybrids can be plugged into an electricity source to recharge their battery.<sup><a href="#section4">[4]</a></sup></li>
          <img src="images/plugin-high-res.jpg" class="img-fluid"/>
          <li><strong>Hybrid-electric&nbsp;-</strong> These run mainly on fuel like petrol or diesel but also have an electric battery too, which is recharged through regenerative braking. These let you switch between using your fuel engine and using 'EV' mode at the touch of a button.&nbsp;These cars cannot be plugged into an electricity source and rely on petrol or diesel for energy.<sup><a href="#section5">[5]</a></sup></li>
