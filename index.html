            <p>
              As per WHO report 10 of the world’s 25 most polluted cities are Indian<sup><a href="#section1">[1]</a></sup>.Over 120,000 people died in India  in 2020 as a result of air pollution and related problems, according to the Greenpeace Southeast Asia Analysis of IQAir data. The report also stated that air pollution caused economic damages to the tune of ₹2 lakh crore in India.<sup><a href="#section2">[2]</a></sup>
              New Delhi is the world’s most polluted capital, and India is home to 35 of the world’s 50 most polluted cities.
  
            </p>
            <p>The transport sector accounts for 18% of total energy consumption in India. This translates to an estimated 94 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE) energy. If India were to follow the current trends of energy consumption, it would require an estimated 200 MTOE of energy supply annually, by the year 2030 to meet the demand of this sector.Moreover, the sector also contributes an estimated 142 Million Tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, out of which 123 million tonnes is contributed by the road transport segment alone.<sup><a href="#section3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
              Keeping in view the climate change commitments made by Government of India during the COP21 Summit held at Paris to reduce emission intensity by 33- 35% by 2030 from 2005 levels, it is pertinent to introduce alternative means in the transport sector which can be coupled with India’s rapid economic growth, rising urbanization, travel demand and country’s energy security. Electric mobility presents a viable alternative in addressing these challenges, when packaged with innovative pricing solutions, appropriate technology and support infrastructure and thus, has been on the radar of Government of India.<sup><a href="#section3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
            <hr>
            <p>The Electric Vehicle industry in India is far behind, with less than 1% of the total vehicle sales. Currently, Indian roads are dominated by conventional vehicles and have approximately 0.4 million electric two-wheelers and a few thousand electric cars only. The Indian EV industry has been on the back seat due to various challenges.

              The government of India have undertaken multiple initiatives to promote manufacturing and adoption of electric vehicles in India. With support of the government, electric vehicles have started penetrating in the Indian market. However, availability of adequate Charging Infrastructure is one of the key requirements for accelerated adoption of electric vehicles in India.<sup><a href="#section3">[3]</a></sup></p>
